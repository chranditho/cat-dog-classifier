# Patch Notes for feature/improve-model-accuracy branch

## Python Code Changes

1. **GPU Support**: Added code to enable GPU support for the model training process. This will significantly speed up
   the training process if a compatible GPU is available.

2. **TensorFlow Version**: Updated the TensorFlow version to the latest one to take advantage of the new features and
   improvements, including the `tf.config` module for better GPU support.

3. **Image Preprocessing**: Added code to preprocess the input images before feeding them to the model. This includes
   resizing the images to a uniform size, converting the images to NumPy arrays, adding an extra dimension to the
   arrays, and normalizing the pixel values.

4. **Model Training**: Updated the model training process to use a generator, which allows the model to be trained on
   large datasets that cannot fit into memory. Also added several callbacks to improve the training process, including
   early stopping, model checkpointing, and learning rate reduction on plateau.

5. **Model Prediction**: Added code to load a trained model and use it to make predictions on new images.
6. **Model**: Is now saved as an `keras` model instead of a `h5` model to follow newer conventions.

## Shell Script Changes

1. **Model Running Script**: Added a shell script to run the model on a new image. The script checks if the image path
   is provided, activates the virtual environment, runs the model, and then deactivates the virtual environment.
2. **Training Script**: Updated/Installed the required packages in the training script to ensure that the model training
   process runs smoothly. Renamed the training script to `train_model.sh` for consistency.

## Documentation Changes

1. **README**: Updated the README file with detailed setup instructions, including how to clone the repository, set up
   the virtual environment, download the dataset, train the model, and run the trained model. Also added explanations
   for the training script parameters and examples of how to use them.
